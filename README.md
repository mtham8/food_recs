### Northern China
[Ji Rong Peking Duck](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ji-rong-peking-duck-rosemead) (Rosemead)
  *  Excellent and authentic peking duck. They serve you the whole duck in different courses (duck soup, peking duck, and others).

[Mama Lu's Dumpling House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mama-lus-dumpling-house-monterey-park-17) (Monterey Park)
* Great dumplings/xiao long baos!

[Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot](https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-sheep-mongolian-hot-pot-pasadena?osq=Little+Fat+Sheep+Hot+Pot) (South Pasadena)
* Best hot pot broth, super herbal but not overbearing, great during the winter with family and friends

[Long Xing Ji](https://www.yelp.com/biz/long-xing-ji-san-gabriel-2) (San Gabriel)
* Known for their palm size soup dumplings and xiao long baos. Vegetarian xiao long baos available! You can see the Asian ladies making your dumplings through a glass window.


### Taiwan
[SinBala Restaurant](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sinbala-restaurant-arcadia-2?osq=taiwanes) (Temple City)
* Authentic Taiwanese comfort food, with shaved ice for dessert. CASH ONLY.

[Jin Tea Shop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/jin-tea-shop-pasadena) (South Pasadena)
* Organic tea imported from Taiwan. Their Oriental Beauty Oolong Tea is good if you like milk in your tea. If you don't, High Mountain Oolong Tea is great with fruit flavors. Their boba is always fresh and delicious.


### Southern China
[Savoy Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/savoy-kitchen-alhambra) (Alhambra)
* Really good Hainan chicken.. and pizza!

[The Congee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-congee-alhambra-2) (Alhambra)
* Golfball-sized wontons (yum), food tastes like it's from an outdoor small food corner shop in HK - pretty good congee too.

[Newport Seafood Restaurant](https://www.yelp.com/biz/newport-seafood-restaurant-san-gabriel-4) (San Gabriel)
* This is one of the restaurants chef David Chang went to in his show, [Ugly Delicious Season 1 Episode 7](https://www.eater.com/2018/2/23/17017880/ugly-delicious-fried-rice-recap-season-1-episode-7), where he ordered off a secret menu... Nonetheless, their House Special Lobster is really good. Not sure why Yelp labels this place 'Vietnamese', because it's definitely Cantonese food.


### Thailand
[Pa Ord Noodle](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pa-ord-noodle-los-angeles-4) (East Hollywood)
* Super authentic Thai food, served in the same portions as Thailand - small, so you can get multiple dishes per person.

[President Thai](https://www.yelp.com/biz/president-thai-pasadena) (East Pasadena)
* Great curry and all around great authentic taste in all dishes.


### Korean
[Young Dong Tofu House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/young-dong-tofu-house-san-gabriel-2?osq=Restaurants) (San Gabriel)
* Delicious soon-du-bu (tofu soup). There's a dish called [Rice with Spicy Seasoned Octopus in Stone Pot](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/young-dong-tofu-house-san-gabriel-2?select=dnntgRlbjVvpSEADbCg8WA) that's really good, and pretty sure I've only seen it on the menu here.


### Vietnam
[Pho Ga Bac Ninh](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-ga-bac-ninh-monterey-park) (Monterey Park)
* Small hole in the wall that serves the best Chicken Pho/Pho Ga - great comfort food. Definitely serving free range chicken.
